# MIMBCD-UI Cornerstone Prototype

<img src="assets/banner.png"/>

[MIMBCD-UI](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) is a Research Project that deals with the use of a recently proposed technique in literature: [Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network). These deep networks will incorporate information from several different modes by a User Interface (UI) implemented using the [Cornerstone Library](https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone). The [Cornerstone](https://github.com/chafey/cornerstone) is an Open Source Project with a goal to deliver a complete web based medical imaging platform. A [demo](http://breastscreening.arditi.pt:8982/src/index.html) is also provided to show the source code of this repository in action.

abstract = {This paper describes the field research, design and comparative deployment of a multimodal medical imaging user interface for breast screening. The main contributions described here are threefold: 1) The design of an advanced visual interface for multimodal diagnosis of breast cancer (BreastScreening); 2) Insights from the field comparison of Single-Modality vs Multi-Modality screening of breast cancer diagnosis with 31 clinicians and 566 images; and 3) The visualization of the two main types of breast lesions in the following image modalities: (i) MammoGraphy (MG) in both Craniocaudal (CC) and Mediolateral oblique (MLO) views; (ii) UltraSound (US); and (iii) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We summarize our work with recommendations from the radiologists for guiding the future design of medical imaging interfaces.},
